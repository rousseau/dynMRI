# dynMRI

This software is dedicated to the estimation of rigid-body motions and bone deformity analysis for the ankle joint in children from a stationnary high-resolution static MRI scan and a set of low-resolution dynamic MRI scans. It can be also adapted for other articulated structures such as the shoulder etc...

## In vivo dynamic evaluation of ankle joint and muscle mechanics
Main contributor: Karim Makki (karim.makki@imt-atlantique.fr)
### Requirements
* OS: Mac OS X and Linux
* FSL: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation
* NiBabel
* All data to analyse need to be in NIFTI format


### Recommendations

  In order to respect the segmentation protocol, it is highly recommended to segment the tibia for a height of 35 mm. To count from the point of contact between the growth cartilage for the tibia on the one hand and the articular cartilage (tibia / talus) on the other hand.
  This software works well especially when the imaged FOV cover the entire structure of each rigid component (or bone of interest) both in the static and in time frames.
  Please keep your input masks in this order (mask1: calcaneus; mask2: talus; mask3: tibia). 

### Command Line Arguments
##### Example
```
python /motion_estimation/motionEstimation.py  \
  -s <path-to-static-image>  \
  -d <path-to-dynamic-image>   \
  -m <path-to-calcaneus-mask-of-static-image>   \
  -m <path-to-talus-mask-of-static-image>   \
  -m <path-to-tibia-mask-of-static-image>   \
  -o <path-to-save-motion-estimation-output>
```
Please keep your input masks (**-m**) in this order:
`mask1: calcaneus; mask2: talus; mask3: tibia`

### Program outputs
This program outputs a folder per component (or mask):
`/outputpath/propagation/output_path_component_i_/`  
Final results of each component are then saved in a specified sub-folder: 
`/outputpath/propagation/output_path_component_i_/final_results/`   
Final results are:
 - Segmentations of the low-resolution time frames
 - Direct transformations from static to each time frame

## Bone Deformity Analysis
This is a tool to analyse ankle bone shape difference between typically developping children (TD) and children with cerebral palsy (CP) using 3D MRI.  
Main contributor: Yue Cheng

### Constructed bone shape template
You can fine the TD ankle joint template and the label of bones of interest in `.\deformity_analysis`, named `template_img.nii.gz` and `template_label.nii.gz`  
Also, the shape templates of calcaneus, talus and tibia are provided both in NIFTI and 3D mesh files, named as `bone.nii.gz` or `bone.stl` respectively

### Requirements
* For template estimation and subject-to-template registration: **ANTs** (http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/)
* To install required Python libraries, please use this command:
```
pip install deformity_analysis/requirements.txt
```

### How to Run
To perform the registration, you can run like this:
```
python deformity_analysis/registration.py \ 
  -n <number-of-thread> \
  -t <path-to-TD-subjects-segmentation-files> \
  -c <path-to-CP-subjects-segmentation-files> \
  -ot <path-to-save-TD-subjects-registration-output> \
  -oc <path-to-save-CP-subjects-registration-output>
```

To perform the anomaly analysis, please run like this:
```
python deformity_analysis/detection.py \ 
  -b <which-bone-to-analysis> \
  -t <path-to-TD-subjects-registration-output> \
  -c <path-to-CP-subjects-registration-output> \
  -o <path-to-save-detection-results>
```
Once the NIFTI format detection results are obtained, you can convert the NIFTI to 3D mesh to facilitate the visualization:
